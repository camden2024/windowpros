      <h3>Window Pros</h3>
      <p>
        [We take pride in our work and strive for precision and excellence in everything we do. We offer a premium wash for your windows, frames, screens, and tracks. However, we have a unique method for cleaning the windows. We use a water fed brush on a pole that extends to reach three stories. We avoid the risk incurred using ladders while still providing the same, if not better, quality of wash. With other tools and chemicals, we are prepared to get rid of hard water, cement, paint overspray, and other construction materials. Reach out for a free quote and to be put in contact with a pro.]

      <p>
        [We can give you an offer within minutes! Call or text us, and we can tell you everything you need. Generally, we just need a picture of all sides of the house in order to count windows and gage their size. We charge approximately $5 per window with higher or lower costs varying by size. Screen cleaning averages an additional $20 with track cleaning costing an additional $2 per window. We are also happy to negotiate special deals where applicable.]

      <h3>Our Services</h3>
      <p>
        [We offer three main services. First, we clean the glass and frames for each window. With a 4 stage water filter, we are able to connect to your hose bib, filter the water, and scrub the windows. Because of the filter, the water has a TDS (total dissolved solids) count of 0, which allows the windows to dry without leaving a mark!]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Next, we clean screens. They can either be removed by you, the homeowner, or by our crew. With a unique sprayer, we get all dirt build-up off and replace the screens with a fresh shine. Special brushes and soaps may be used if necessary.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Finally, we clean the often overlooked tracks. They collect all sorts of bugs, mud, dust, and much more over the months between each clean. That's why we are here. With our water fed brush, most debris comes off very easily. The rest can be removed by hand.]
